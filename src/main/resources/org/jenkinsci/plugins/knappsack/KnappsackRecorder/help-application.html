<div>
    Specify the id of the application you want to upload a build for.
    It usually is the number following the KNAPPSACK/detail/ url, e.g.
    http://myknappsack.com/detail/123 . You can add multiple application ids using ',' as separator. Take care,
    the number of application ids MUST match the number of artifact files.
